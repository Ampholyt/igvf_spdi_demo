# Demo of using SPDI tools for IGVF variant lists

Here I provide a demo for some of the NCBI tools for adding SPDI
unique IDs to variant lists. Briefly the benefits of SPDI:

* resolves indel ambiguity
* validates unique IDs, e.g. incorrect alt/ref
* human readable, unique ID with broad usage across consortia
  (dbSNP, ClinVar, etc.), NCBI support including API and toolkits

See the following for a tutorial on NCBI tools:
